This library lets an ATmega328 drive an ST7565-based GLCD display.

First use by JeeLabs: http://jeelabs.org/2010/11/15/meet-the-graphics-board/

Derived from code in the ST7565 library by Adafruit, hence under LGPL license.

Unpack the archive and rename the result to `GLCDlib`.  
Put it in the `libraries` folder in your Arduino sketches area.  
Restart the Arduino IDE to make sure it sees the new files.
